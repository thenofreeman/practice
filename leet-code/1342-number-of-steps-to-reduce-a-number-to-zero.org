#+title: Number Of Steps To Reduce A Number To Zero

Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.

In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

Example 1:

#+begin_src
Input: num = 14
Output: 6
#+end_src

/Explanation:/

1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.
2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.
4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.
5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

Example 2:

#+begin_src
Input: num = 8
Output: 4
#+end_src

/Explanation:/
1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4.
2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2.
3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

Example 3:

#+begin_src
Input: num = 123
Output: 12
#+end_src

Constraints:
- 0 <= num <= 106

int numberOfSteps(int num)
{
    int steps {0};
    while (num > 0)
    {
        if (num % 2 == 0)
            num >>= 1;
        else
            num -= 1;

        ++steps;
    }
    return steps;
}
#+end_src
