Assuming many teenagers of the world have switched to the new hot social app called BAPC (Bidirectional and Private Communication) in 2023. 
This app has some stricter social rules than previous social apps such as snapchat and Instagram.
For example, if someone greets you with "he...ey", you have to respond with "hee...eey" as well, but using twice as many e's!

Given a string of the form he...ey of length at most 1000, print the greeting you will respond with, containing twice as many e's.

/Input Specification:/
- The input consists of one line containing a single string s as specified, of length at least 3 and at most 1000.

/Output Specification:/
- hey : heey
- heeeeey : heeeeeeeeeey
