#+title: Lab 1 - Fade Without Delay

* Info

1. Start the Arduino IDE and examine the IDE.
2. Checkout an Arduino.
3. DO NOT use a blue USB connection (Its USB 3 and not compatible).
4. Make sure the Mega 2560 and the correct com port is selected using the Tools menu.
5. Run Blink for the built-in LED.
6. Get parts for Blink external LED example.
7. Run Blink for an external LED.
8. Run BlinkWithoutDelay.
9. Run Fade (will need to modify hardware setup).
10. Modify Fade to not use Delay and instead use millis() with an interval as in BlinkWithoutDelay.
11. Demo the project in lab to the instructor.
12.  Turn in your code for your Fade_Without_Delay.

* C++ (Arduino)

#+begin_src C++
int led = 13;            // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int brightness = 0;      // how bright the LED is
int fadeAmount = 5;      // how many points to fade the LED by
const int interval = 30; // millisecond interval delay per change in brightness
unsigned long prev = 0;  // the previous millisecond count

void setup() {
    // declare pin 13 to be an output:
    pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
    unsigned long curr = millis(); // the current millisecond count

    if (curr - prev >= interval) {
        prev = curr;

        // set the brightness of pin 13:
        analogWrite(led, brightness);

        // change the brightness for next time through the loop:
        brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;

        // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade:
        if (brightness <= 0 || brightness >= 255) {
            fadeAmount = -fadeAmount;
        }
    }
}
