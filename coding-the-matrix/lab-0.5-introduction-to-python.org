* Task 0.5.7

The value of the previous comprehension,

#+begin_src python
{x*y for x in {1,2,3} for y in {2,3,4}}
#+end_src

is a seven-element set. 

Replace {1,2,3} and {2,3,4} with two other three-elements sets so that the value becomes a nine-element set.

#+begin_src python
{x*y for x in {1,2,10} for y in {1,3,4}}
#+end_src

* Task 0.5.8

Replace the same comprehension from Task 0.5.7 with two disjoint three-element sets so that the value becomes a five-element set.

#+begin_src python
{x*y for x in {0,-3,1} for y in {-1,3,-9}}
#+end_src
